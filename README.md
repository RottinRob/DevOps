Obviously there is content that is not of my making from schoolwork, all of which is content under some version of GPL, APL, or other "open" resource licence. My content should be obvious! 

Content created as team projects will be fully documented with proper credit to said author of content.(Please don't kill me guys if I misspell a name or dozen...sorry!)

All content made for other individuals has had content permissions addressed fully and is encluded with the individuals complete blessings. Please use common sense, decency, and respect with such content.

This is a repository to display my projects and active code written along the way during my voyage through technology. There is full code content, snippets and unfinished messes..I tinker learn and play with code...I always have, I love it.

HTML is one of my special fondnesses due to it versatility, robustness, and down right ease of use and learning. It also is a one of the full scale languages I ever learned that was interactive, visual, and nearly limitless. I was actually able to see more than ASCII art...it was, when I first learned it, amazing technology...and for me at least, it still is!
